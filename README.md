# OCTO Australia - Tech Foundations
Hands On and Labs for newcomers at OCTO Technology Australia

<img src="./static/foundations.jpg" />

## Overview

As you know at OCTO we love technology.

What are those foundations? A list of technology we consider that everybody **at OCTO must know.
This **list is minimalist** on purpose. The goal is to kick-start yourself if you need on all of them, not to make you a master in a few hours.
Obviously, you can dig as much as you want to after on any of them and help us to update its content or suggest new topics: Pull Request accepted :)

Welcome on-board!
